# Unity-MCP Benchmark Execution Plan

This plan translates Unity-MCP benchmark patterns into actionable work for Gear without changing runtime scope in documentation-only phases.

## Benchmark Focus Areas

Based on the Unity MCP landscape in `ANALYSIS.md`, the most relevant baseline capabilities are:

1. Editor/runtime visibility
2. Build and validation automation
3. Scene hierarchy and asset workflow ergonomics
4. Stable operational feedback loops (logs, error surfaces)

## Execution Tracks

### Track A — Documentation & Structure Alignment

- Keep architecture, roadmap, and release docs easy to discover.
- Align benchmark intent with concrete docs under `docs/`.
- No runtime behavior changes.

### Track B — CI/Test Reinforcement

- Expand CI into explicit gates (build/typecheck/tests/audit).
- Add deterministic test coverage that can run in PR context.
- Keep feature behavior unchanged.

### Track C — Operational Standardization

- Normalize provider/server-side logging format.
- Standardize error string shaping for easier troubleshooting.
- Avoid functional behavior drift while improving observability.

## Success Criteria

- PR-A: doc discoverability improves; runtime diff remains zero.
- PR-B: CI gives clearer pass/fail signal per quality gate.
- PR-C: logs/errors are consistent and easier to grep/triage.
