# Changelog

All notable changes to Gear (godot-mcp) will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [2.3.6] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed
- `modify_script` now passes operation params through temp files so Windows command-line escaping no longer breaks function bodies containing `\t`, `\r`, or quoted strings.
- `get_editor_status` now reports bridge startup failures such as `EADDRINUSE`, making duplicate-server editor bridge conflicts visible instead of looking like a silent disconnect.
- Bridge-backed scene tools now coerce common `Vector2`-style `{x,y}` objects and `[x,y]` arrays for typed properties such as `position` and `scale`.
- Runtime addon polling now re-checks socket state after `poll()` before calling `get_available_bytes()`, avoiding shutdown-time socket errors.

### Improved
- Scene tool docs now show the required typed JSON shape for bridge-backed Godot values such as `Vector2`.
- Dynamic tool-group docs now call out the reconnect/manual-refresh fallback for MCP clients that cache `tools/list` too aggressively.
- Packaging consistency release checks now tolerate `npm pack --json` output even when npm prepends `prepare`/build logs.

## [2.3.5] - 2026-03-24

### Changed
- Extracted static server metadata out of `src/index.ts` into focused helper modules to reduce entrypoint sprawl without changing MCP behavior.
- Shell-hook installation is now explicitly opt-in during postinstall; `Gear setup` remains the supported manual path.

### Improved
- Added metadata consistency regression coverage for package/server version and initialize-time server info.
- Synchronized release-facing docs and metadata with the current prompt/resource/tool surface and install behavior.

## [2.3.4] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed
- Runtime live-inspection tools now relay runtime addon responses consistently.
- Runtime screenshot capture returns image content reliably for automation flows.
- OpenAI-facing tool names are sanitized before exposure to clients.
- Windows setup now skips unsupported shell-hook installation steps.

### Improved
- Node-based test spawning and CI dependency audit handling are more stable during release verification.
- README community links were refreshed by removing the expired Discord invite.

## [2.3.3] - 2026-03-09

### Fixed
- Runtime addon framing handling now tolerates welcome and pong responses more reliably
- Runtime status checks now verify addon connectivity more accurately
- ClassDB MCP responses and node-path helper synchronization issues were corrected
- Postinstall setup hook behavior was hardened for cross-platform compatibility on Windows

### Improved
- CI/test coverage, observability, and documentation/structure updates from recent main branch work are now included in the npm release

## [2.0.0] - 2025-02-20

### Added
- **MCP Resources**: `godot://` URI protocol for scene, script, and resource file access with path traversal protection
- **GDScript LSP Integration**: 4 tools (`lsp_get_diagnostics`, `lsp_get_completions`, `lsp_get_hover`, `lsp_get_symbols`) via Godot's built-in Language Server (port 6005)
- **Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP)**: 7 tools (`dap_get_output`, `dap_set_breakpoint`, `dap_remove_breakpoint`, `dap_continue`, `dap_pause`, `dap_step_over`, `dap_get_stack_trace`) via Godot's built-in DAP (port 6006)
- **Screenshot Capture**: `capture_screenshot` and `capture_viewport` tools via runtime addon TCP
- **Input Injection**: `inject_action`, `inject_key`, `inject_mouse_click`, `inject_mouse_motion` tools via runtime addon TCP
- **npm Publishing**: Package available as `Gear` on npm (`npx Gear`)
- Lazy LSP/DAP client initialization (connects only when first tool is called)
- Graceful cleanup of LSP/DAP connections on server shutdown

### Changed
- Rebranded from "Godot MCP" to "Gear"
- Server identity updated to `Gear` v2.0.0
- Updated README with new features, tool reference, and `npx` install instructions
- Package version bumped to 2.0.0
